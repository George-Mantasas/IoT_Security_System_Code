-----------------------------IoT Security Systems--------------------------------

My name is George Mantasas and I'm from Greece.

As part of my thesis on 'IoT Security Systems in Theory and Practice,' 
I created an IoT security system from scratch using an ESP32 and various sensors. 
Along with the hardware, I also developed the cloud-based software for managing the security system and sending notifications.
